# temperature-app-mobile

A mobile app built with React Native to convert temperatures from Celsius for Fahrenheit, or vice-versa. Temperature conversion is done with an [HTTP Google Cloud Function](https://github.com/jasminesung/temperature-app-backend).

To run the app locally:

1. Run `npm install`.

2. Run `npm start`. The app will be launched with Expo.

You can use the app on your mobile device with the Expo app by clicking this [link](https://exp.host/@jasminesung1130/mobile). :D
